# Exploiting DNS

Internet domain names are located and converted to IP addresses by the Domain Name System (DNS). It may be a useful tool.
Organizations frequently permit the protocol to exit restricted networks, and they usually do not sufficiently control its use, making it a weapon in the hands of an attacker. Smart attackers can take advantage of these problems at almost every stage of an attack chain, including reconnaissance, command and control (C2), and even data exfiltration. It just requires a little bit of understanding. You'll learn how to create your own utilities in this chapter by using Go and third-party packages to carry out some of these functions.
